      <description>In the past couple of years I have had extensive experience using technologies like R, Python, SQL, Spark and gained a lot of hands on experience in the domains of data wrangling, data manipulation, modeling, data analytics as well as data visualization using tools such as Tableau and PowerBI.
I think I have the skillsets and the fortitude to succeed in this domain. I have a methodical and rational approach to solving problems, I work promptly and diligently so I can stick to deadlines and I pay very close attention to the small details all of which lend well to being a competent analyst.</description>
